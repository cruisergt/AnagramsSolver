# Anagrams
Struggling to beat someone at a game that requires forming anagrams quickly? Use this instead!
Download all these files, compile AnagramsDriver.java and run it with one argument, a String that contains the characters you need to form anagrams with, and boom, you're done! My program will form all possible anagrams and check them against the dictionary file provided. If you want to use a different dictionary file, you are free to; just change the argument for the createDictionary method to your dictionary file name and you are all set.
